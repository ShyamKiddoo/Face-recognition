# Face-recognition
To create a face recognition software using Python and OpenCV to detect the number of faces in a real time video and print the count of the faces
Run the face.py code which will import the opencv file for face detection
This code will invoke your webcam to detect the faces and to print the count of total number of faces.
This code is a part of my College project which uses this software to take the gym attendance using real time CCTV footage.
